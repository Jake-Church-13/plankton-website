  <h1>Spring 2025: Environmental Drivers of Plankton Community Variation</h1>

  <section>
    <h2>Methods: PCA of Environmental Structuring</h2>
    <p>To explore how environmental conditions structure plankton communities, a Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was performed using four abiotic variables: salinity, dissolved oxygen (DO), nitrate, and silicate. These variables were measured at 0.3 meters depth across six weeks at two sites: Eld Inlet and Boston Harbor.</p>
    <p>Plankton community data were collected at each site and week using abundance codes for each species (0 = Absent, 1 = Present, 2 = Common, 3 = Blooming). These data were transformed into a species matrix, while the environmental variables were standardized (z-scores) and used to perform PCA. The first two principal components (PC1 and PC2) were extracted and visualized to create a biplot showing the distribution of site-week samples in relation to environmental gradients.</p>
    <p>Each point in the biplot represents a unique Station × Week sample, with colors indicating station identity and text labels indicating sampling week. Arrows represent the direction and strength of correlation between environmental variables and the principal components.</p>

    <h2>Interpretation of Results</h2>
    <p>The PCA biplot reveals clear environmental differentiation between sites and sampling weeks:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>PC1</strong> accounts for the largest proportion of variation and appears to reflect a combined gradient of salinity and nitrate. Samples scoring high along PC1 were generally associated with higher values of these variables.</li>
      <li><strong>PC2</strong> represents secondary variation, possibly linked to differences in dissolved oxygen and silicate availability across sites and weeks.</li>
      <li>Samples from Eld Inlet and Boston Harbor cluster differently in ordination space, suggesting distinct environmental regimes driving plankton community composition at each location.</li>
      <li>Temporal trends are visible through week labels. For example, later-season samples (e.g., Week 8) may show divergence from earlier weeks (e.g., Week 2), likely due to seasonal shifts in environmental drivers and associated changes in phytoplankton dominance (e.g., diatoms vs. dinoflagellates).</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Temperature Overlay</h2>
    <p>To explore how temperature co-varies with environmental gradients, PCA results were color-mapped using in situ temperature data (°C) collected at 0.3 m depth. Although temperature was not directly included in the PCA due to high collinearity with dissolved oxygen (r = 0.82), this visualization reveals clear thermal structuring across sites and sampling weeks.</p>
    <p>Warmer samples (red hues) tend to cluster along gradients associated with lower DO and nitrate, while cooler samples (blue hues) align with more oxygenated, nutrient-rich conditions. This supports the conclusion that temperature interacts strongly with oxygen and nutrient regimes, indirectly influencing plankton community structure.</p>

    <h2>Dino:Diatom Ratio (Raw)</h2>
    <div class="caption">Comparative Dino:Diatom abundance ratio (not a proportion) across weeks and sites.</div>
    <img src="output(3).png" alt="Dino:Diatom Ratio Plot">
    <p>To assess functional shifts in the phytoplankton community, a Dino:Diatom ratio was calculated by dividing the total abundance scores of dinoflagellates by those of diatoms at each site and week. These scores were based on a semi-quantitative scale (0 = Absent, 1 = Present, 2 = Common, 3 = Blooming). The resulting ratio is not a proportion but a comparative index: values >1 indicate dinoflagellate dominance, while values <1 indicate diatom dominance. This approach captures relative bloom tendencies rather than overall community composition.</p>
