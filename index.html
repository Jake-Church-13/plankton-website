  <section class="section">
    <h2>Methods: PCA of Environmental Structuring</h2>
    <p>To explore how environmental conditions structure plankton communities, a Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was performed using four abiotic variables: salinity, dissolved oxygen (DO), nitrate, and silicate. These variables were measured at 0.3 meters depth across six weeks at two sites: Eld Inlet and Boston Harbor.</p>
    <p>Plankton community data were collected at each site and week using abundance codes for each species (0 = Absent, 1 = Present, 2 = Common, 3 = Blooming). These data were transformed into a species matrix, while the environmental variables were standardized (z-scores) and used to perform PCA. The first two principal components (PC1 and PC2) were extracted and visualized to create a biplot showing the distribution of site-week samples in relation to environmental gradients.</p>
    <p>Each point in the biplot represents a unique Station Ã— Week sample, with colors indicating station identity and text labels indicating sampling week. Arrows represent the direction and strength of correlation between environmental variables and the principal components.</p>

    <div class="caption">The Dino:Diatom ratio was calculated by dividing total dinoflagellate scores by total diatom scores at each site-week. Ratios >1 indicate dinoflagellate dominance; <1 indicates diatom dominance. This ratio is based on summed abundance codes rather than proportions, enabling direct comparison of bloom magnitude and dominance shifts.</div>

    <h2>ðŸ’¡ Nutrient Requirements of Diatoms vs. Dinoflagellates</h2>
    <p>Phytoplankton growth and community composition are tightly linked to nutrient availability. The classical Redfield Ratio (16:1 ratio of nitrate to phosphate) is often used to describe the optimal nutrient balance for marine phytoplankton. However, <strong>diatoms</strong> also require <strong>silicate</strong> to build their siliceous frustules (shells), making their nutrient needs more complex than those of <strong>dinoflagellates</strong>, which do not require silicate.</p>
    <p>In this study:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Diatoms</strong> were associated with high levels of both nitrate and silicate. When silicate was limiting, diatom blooms were suppressed even in the presence of ample nitrate.</li>
      <li><strong>Dinoflagellates</strong>, requiring only nitrate, were observed to dominate under conditions where nitrate was available but silicate was depleted, suggesting competitive release.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This nutrient dynamic provides a mechanistic explanation for the temporal and spatial patterns of plankton dominance observed in the RDA and ratio plots.</p>
